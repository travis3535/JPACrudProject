## SPRING MCV JPA C.R.U.D. Project

#### Week 9 Homework Project for Skill Distillery



### Overview
* This is a Formula One database! In this database users will be able to view all
active Formula One teams and important data regarding each team.
Users will be able to create their own team and fill out all available options.
They will also be able to search by id, modify existing teams, and delete teams
as they see fit.


### Technologies and Tools Used

* Java
* SQL and MySQL
* C.R.U.D.
* Spring Tool Suite
* JDBC
* JSP's
* Gradle
* Apache Tomcat
* HTML
* SQL Workbench

### Lessons Learned

* In this lesson, we learned how to create and manager our own database.
  This was a very intuitive lesson, as this is the first lesson we have created
  our own database, deployed it using Spring, and SQL Workbench.
* The main focus for me on this homework was to make sure the functionality of my
  project was fully working before I attempted any styling for my page.
